## Purpose of mini project

### OOP

- As discussed in a previous repo (OOP-Python) this project aims to put into practice the 4 pillars of OOP

- This project also uses testing and python based unittesting ('if __name__ == __main__')

- Assert statements used in unit testing are similar to those seen in languages such as Java

- This project also aims to demonstrate some simple TDD (test driven development)

- Examples of class inheritance and object instansiation are also shown
  e.g.
  
  ````class Example:
        print('Hello')
      ....
      class OtherExample:
      new_example = Example()
      print(new_example)````
      
The output should be 'Hello'

### Programming logic

- If, elif, else statements and control flow
- Boolean logic (AND/OR)
- The unit test code determines that the logic used in the control flow is accurate. 
- This can be run through pycharm or another similar compiler to determine this is valid.
